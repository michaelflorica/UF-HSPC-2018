Contest data for the 2018 UF High School Programming Contest. HSPC is an outreach event hosted at UF for high schoolers interested in competitive programming and computer science in general. Included are problems with judge-data, judge-solutions, and two scripts I wrote for checking consistency across different solutions for the problems and generating answers for test-cases (the problem directories also include python scripts for test case generation). The problems were all written by me with the exception of Keypad.
